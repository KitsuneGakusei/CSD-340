    <h1>Assignment 9.3: JavaScript - Part 1</h1>

    <p>Your face is like a map of <span id="emotion">_________</span>, each feature a landmark I've grown to know well.  
    The lines of your smile chart the way back home, and the look in your eyes tells stories without words.</p>

    <p>The smile that leads into your <span id="dimples">_________</span>, playful and warm, softens the harshest days.  
    There's a comfort in your laugh, like sunshine after rain, or music that hums gently in the background.</p>

    <p>Your freckles smattered like <span id="stars">_________</span> across a night sky, scattered perfectly by the universe.  
    Each one a spark, a note in a celestial map, guiding me gently toward the truth found in your gaze.</p>

    <p>Guiding me towards your bright and shining <span id="eyes">_________</span>, where calm resides and love reflects.  
    In your eyes, I find courage, clarity, and the kind of peace that doesnâ€™t need to be explained.</p>
